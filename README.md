# Hotstrings
AutoHotkey oriented GUI to Hotstrings with many useful features:
- applying clipboard instead of the classical simulation of keyboard (useful especially for long text strings),
- one triggering abbreviation can call several different text strings of your choice, chosen from menu,
- overview of existing hotstrings,
- definitions of hotstrings are stored in .csv files, as many, as you like,
- undoing of hotstrings (conversion of last entered hotstring again into triggering abbreviation),
- ...

This application is written in AutoHotkey script language but does not require this language interpreter to be installed and can be run standalone thanks to .exe file. (Nevertheless installation of [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is greatly adviced). The concept and usage of hotstrings is based on AutoHotkey [hotstring]((https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotstrings.htm) notion.

The hotstrings defined in this application are operating system wide. It means that can be triggered in any text / edit window, in any application.

This application will run on Microsoft Windows family operating systems.

# What are the hotstrings (absolute beginner quide)
There are two notions:
**triggering abbreviation** ‚Üí **hotstring**

When someone enters the triggering abbreviation, it will be automatically replaced with hotstring.

Thanks to this application one can define as many pairs (triggering abbreviation and hotstring) as she/he likes and store them in convenient way in separate .csv files. Each file can contain hotstring belonging to specific category, e.g. emojis, physical symbols, first and second names etc.

# Why somobody may want to use hotstrings?
Because they can significantly make life easier and better. Nowadays we still frequently use keyboard as input device to so called personal computer. This computer is not so "personal" as you can't easily define system wide (working in any application) triggering abbreviation in form of jg/ ‚Üí Jane Goodall or for sake of your e-mail jg@ ‚Üí jane.goodall@yourhosing.com. So let's make your PC really personal again. Now with use of hotstrings.

# Main window
After installation just double click on the Hotstrings icon (marked in red) in system tray ![Example of system tray](/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_SystemTray.png) or... use hotkey Ctrl + # + h (Control + Windows key + h).
Next you'll see main GUI (Graphical User Interface) window which enable you to edit hotstrings:

![Main window](/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_MainWindow.png)

The main window can be divided into the following parts:
- Hotstring menu,
- Hotstring definition / edition,
- Display of existing hotstrings.

## Hotstring menu
![Main menu](/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_MainMenu.png)
- Monitor
- Search Hotstrings
- Delay
- Help
- About

In order to access menu by keyboard just press the left Alt key.

### Monitor
Enable choice of the monitor where main GUI window is shown. If GUI window is closed, application continues to run (system tray icon is still accessible). When GUI window is called again (by pressing the hotkey or by clicking with mouse) it will be displayed at monitor of your choice.

### Search Hotstrings
Enable searching of hotstring in any of the categories. All .csv files (category files) are searched. This option is helpful e.g. to find duplicates of hotstrings.

### Delay
Enable change of the delay between copying of the hotstring from clipboard to specific text window from which it was triggered.
By default equal to 200 ms. Maximum value equal to 500 ms (0.5 s).

**Tip:** Sometimes when long hotstrings are triggered and clipboard is applied to immediately enter it, strange behaviour can occurre. Instead of expected hotstring the previous content of clipboard may appear. The reason is that operating system can not gurantee the time to insert the content of clipboard into specific window / editing field. In order to support operating system enlarge the delay. The shorter the delay than better, but if too short, mentioned behaviour can be observed.

**Hotstrings.ahk (script)**. 
*Let's make your PC personal again...*
Enables convenient definition and use of hotstrings (triggered by shortcuts longer text strings). This is 3rd edition of this application, 2020 by Jakub Masiak and Maciej S≈Çojewski (üêò).

## Hotstring definition / edition
The new hotstring is defined from top to bottom of the screen. Let's see how it's made, step by step, with the following example:

**triggering abbreviation **|‚Üí| **hotstring**
------------------------|-|-------------------
btw/ | ‚Üí | by the way

### Enter triggering abbreviation
This edit field enable you to enter any triggering abbreviation. In our example it will be equal to *btw/*.

**Tip:** It's worth to differentiate somehow triggering abbreviations from other words. It can be easily the case that the same word is used as the triggering abbreviation and the word itself. So to trigger on purpose it's good to add to triggering abbreviation unique sign / key, which can be easily reached and is seldomly used otherwise. The perfect candidate for that puspose is "/" (slash).

### Triggering options

The following options are described. After full name of each option, in parenthesis one can find short notation used in AutoHotkey for compatibility, if available.

#### Immediate Execute (*)
No ending sequence is required. Another words as soon as triggering abbreviation is finished, immediately it's exchanged into hotstring. 

By default hotstrings are triggered when triggering abbreviation is finished with ending character, which by default is space ( ), dot (.), coma (,) etc. Examples:

 triggering abbreviation without immediate execute: btw/( )
 triggering abbreviation with immediate execute: btw/
 
 #### No Backspace (B0)
 The triggering sequence is kept in memory and is not exchanged (erased) automatically. In order to erase the letters (but not from memory), the backspace can be used. For that purpose apply curly brackets, and within BackSpace word and number indicating how many backspaces should be applied. E.g. {BackSpace 3} ‚Üê 3x backspaces will be triggered.
 
 **Tip:** Abbreviations and conversion of lower case to uppercase. Let's follow the following example: Jane would like to use api triggering abbreviation for both purposes:
 1. to automatically convert this abbreviation lower case to uppercase.
 2. to trigger the hotstring Application Programming Interface.
 
 For that purpose Jane defined two hotstrings:
 **triggering abbreviation **|‚Üí| **hotstring**
------------------------|-|------------------
 api | Immediate Execute, No Backspace | {BackSpace 3}API
 api/ | Immediate Execute | Application Programming Interface
 
 These two hotstrings work as a pair: thanks to "No Backspace" option the triggering abbreviation is kept in memory. 
 
 If Jane writes api, this abbreviation triggers immediately hotstring API. Next, if Jane decides to add "/" to hotstring API: API/, then API/ works as next triggering abbreviation which unfold to hotstring Application Programming Interface. 
 
 **Tip:** Immediate execute is not always welcomed. It's better to use it only if chances that certain abbreviation will not occurre within other words. Good example is word led which can be used as LED (Light Emitting Diode), but is also usde in e.g. word ledge. In such a case carefully define a triggering abbreviation or use udoing method.
 
 #### No End Char (O)
 
 #### Case Sensitive (C)
 
 #### Inside Word (?)
 
 #### Disable
 
 # Undoing of the last hotsring
 The last hotstring can be easily undone by pressing Cltr + z hotkey or Ctrl + Backspace. 
 
 **Caution:** In some applications the same hotkeys are used for undoing the last action. Then the overall result sometimes is unpredictable or unwanted. In case of some trouble use undoing hotstring several times in a raw.
