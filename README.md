# Hotstrings
AutoHotkey oriented GUI to Hotstrings with many useful features:
- applying clipboard (useful especially for long text strings),
- one hotstring can call several strings, chosen from menu,
- overview of existing hotstrings,
- definitions of hotstrings are stored in .csv files, as many, as you like,
- ...

This application is written in AutoHotkey script language but does not require this language interpreter to be installed and can be run standalone thanks to .exe file. (Nevertheless installation of [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is greatly adviced). The concept and usage of hotstrings is based on AutoHotkey hotstring notion.

# What are the hotstrings (absolute beginner quide)
There are two notions:
**triggering abbreviation** â†’ **hotstring**

When someone enters the triggering abbreviation, it will be automatically replaced with hotstring.

Thanks to this application one can define as many pairs (triggering abbreviation and hotstring) as she/he likes and store them in convenient way in separate .csv files. Each file can contain hotstring belonging to specific category, e.g. emojis, physical symbols, first and second names etc.

# Main window
After installation just double click on the Hotstrings icon (marked in red) in system tray ![Example of system tray](/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_SystemTray.png) or... use hotkey Ctrl + # + h (Control + Windows key + h).
Next you'll see main GUI (Graphical User Interface) window which enable you to edit hotstrings:
